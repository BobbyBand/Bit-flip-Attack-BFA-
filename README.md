## 📘 Project Description

**Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs)** are a class of adversarial attacks that directly manipulate the memory (e.g., weights in quantized models) at the bit level to degrade neural network performance.

This repo includes:
- 🔬 Research notes and references
- 🧪 Code for implementing and simulating BFAs
- 📊 Results and visualizations of attack effectiveness
- 🛡️ Defense and mitigation strategy tests

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand vulnerabilities of quantized DNNs to low-level memory attacks
- Reproduce key experiments from papers (e.g., *"Bit-Flip Attack: Crushing Neural Network with Progressive Bit Search"*)
- Evaluate impact on accuracy, robustness, and inference reliability
- Explore lightweight detection or mitigation techniques
